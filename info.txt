
to build the program file and the keyboard hook library
i used Delphi 5.01 with modified system units (VCL code
stripped) and then i shrinked the program with UPX 1.02 
(the library is integrated as resource in the exe file)

to unpack the program file execute: "upx -d AgeKey.exe"

be noticed: this program is only a simple demonstration
how to write a global keyboard hook with the ability to
hide/modify keyboard messages
however it's a fully functional program for private use
only
